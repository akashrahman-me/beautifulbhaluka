# Social Profile Screen Updates - Summary

## Changes Made (October 17, 2025)

### 1. **Removed Story Highlights Section**
- ✅ Completely removed the `StoryHighlightsSection()` from the profile screen layout
- ✅ The section was previously displayed only for the user's own profile (when `isOwnProfile` is true)
- ✅ Removed unused composable functions: `StoryHighlightsSection()`, `AddHighlightCard()`, `StoryHighlightCard()`
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports (BorderStroke, LazyRow)

### 2. **Story Highlight Shape Changes** (For Future Use)
Although the story highlights section was removed from the profile screen, the component functions were updated to use a **square shape with 2:4 aspect ratio** instead of circular design, in case they're needed elsewhere:

**Previous Design:**
- Shape: Circle (CircleShape)
- Size: 80.dp × 80.dp (1:1 ratio)

**New Design:**
- Shape: Rounded Rectangle (RoundedCornerShape with 12.dp radius)
- Size: 80.dp width × 160.dp height (2:4 ratio or 1:2 ratio)
- Modern rounded corners for better visual appeal

### 3. **Profile Screen Structure** (After Removal)

The updated profile screen now flows as follows:
1. Cover Photo & Profile Picture Section
2. Name & Bio Section
3. Action Buttons Row (Edit Profile, Story, Message, etc.)
4. **Intro Section** ← Now appears right after action buttons
5. Friends Preview Section
6. Photos Preview Section
7. Create Post Section (if own profile)
8. Tabbed Content Section (Posts, About, Friends, Photos)

### 4. **Architecture Compliance**

✅ Follows **MVVM Architecture Pattern**
✅ Uses **Jetpack Compose** for UI
✅ Maintains **clean separation of concerns**
✅ Follows **Material 3 Design** guidelines
✅ All changes are in the **Presentation Layer** only

### 5. **Code Quality**

- No compilation errors
- Only minor warnings for unused parameters (placeholder implementations)
- Clean and maintainable code structure
- Consistent with project coding standards

## Files Modified

1. **SocialProfileScreen.kt**
   - Location: `app/src/main/java/com/akash/beautifulbhaluka/presentation/screens/social/profile/SocialProfileScreen.kt`
   - Lines changed: Removed ~150 lines of story highlights code
   - Updated documentation comments

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test profile screen layout without story highlights section
2. Verify smooth scroll behavior
3. Check that all other sections render correctly
4. Test both own profile and other user's profile views

## Notes

- The `formatCount()` utility function is still present for future use (e.g., formatting follower counts)
- The `showMoreOptions` state is ready for implementing a more options dialog
- All existing functionality remains intact
