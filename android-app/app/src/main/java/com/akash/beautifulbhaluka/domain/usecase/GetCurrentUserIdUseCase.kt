// This use case is not currently needed.
// User authentication is handled directly in the ViewModel with a mock ID.
// TODO: Implement proper authentication service integration in the future.

// Removed to avoid compilation errors due to missing AuthRepository.
// When authentication is implemented, recreate this use case with proper dependencies.
