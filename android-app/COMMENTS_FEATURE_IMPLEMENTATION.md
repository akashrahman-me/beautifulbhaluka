```

### Navigation Flow:
```
SocialFeedScreen → Click Comment Button → CommentsScreen

## 🚀 How to Use

### Navigate to Comments:
The comment button in PostCard now navigates to the CommentsScreen automatically.

### Test the Feature:
1. Build and run the app
2. Go to Social Feed
3. Click the comment icon on any post
4. View comments, add new ones, reply, like, etc.

### Mock Data:
The repository includes mock comments and replies for testing. Replace with real API calls when backend is ready.

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Backend Integration (Future):
Replace mock data in `SocialRepositoryImpl.kt`:
- `getComments()` → API call to fetch comments
- `addComment()` → POST request to create comment
- `addReply()` → POST request to create reply
- `likeComment()` → PUT request to like
- `deleteComment()` → DELETE request

### Firebase Integration (Optional):
```kotlin
private val commentsRef = Firebase.firestore
    .collection("posts/{postId}/comments")

suspend fun getComments(postId: String): Result<List<Comment>> {
    return try {
        val snapshot = commentsRef
            .orderBy("createdAt", Query.Direction.DESCENDING)
            .get()
            .await()
        Result.success(snapshot.toObjects(Comment::class.java))
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Result.failure(e)
    }
}
```
