By following our architecture
In the `Craftsman` screen, instead of section type titlebar, use our `screentopbar` reuable component

and implement `publish` screen where user will add details.

in the publish screen will have those field:

-   নাম
-   ঠিকানা
-   মোবাইল নাম্বার
-   ছবি,
-   মিস্ত্রির ধরন/ক্যাটাগরি

---

Entertainment screen seems doesn't impelemeneted it. please implement similar to the craftsmanscreen.
it will have only those type of category:

-   সাউন্ড সিস্টেমে
-   ব্যান্ড পার্টি

and those field in publish screen

-   নাম, ঠিকানা, মোবাইল নাম্বার, ছবি, ক্যাটাগরি

for UI, just use mock data with open source image url.

be sure you follow our architecture I attached and ensure design it ultra-modern, professional, visually clean with smooth spacing, consistent typography, clear hierarchy, intuitive navigation, modern colors, possible place use linear gradient. Use icons where possible and reuse existing components when available. And at the end you don't need to write any markdown documentation to explain.

1. Along with the blood group, it will show the total number of donors for that group. It should also show the total number of all donors.
2. The blood icon should be colored red.
3. The profile card is blending into the background, so add a light border color to the card or increase the shadow.\*\*
4. There is a lot of empty space between the blood group and the Facebook/WhatsApp icons on the profile card. In that empty space, show the total number of blood donations. When the donation date is updated, the number of total donations should increase accordingly.

1. **There is no option to add a photo. Please add a photo upload option.**
2. **For the last blood donation date, the date has to be typed manually. But clicking there should open a calendar so the date can be selected from it.**
3. **Add a field for total blood donations.**
